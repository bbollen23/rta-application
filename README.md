### Overview

The real-time assessment application is a front-end prototype for a tutoring data visualization dashboard. The goal is to allow a group of tutors to record progress of students, identify weaknesses, and track sessions. This scheme is designed to be an alternative to test-based scoring in that the student is assessed on progress that a tutor can see, rather than just looking at a final score. 

### Running

If you'd like to use the source code, you may install the necessary packages using 

npm install

Then, 

npm start

to actually run the app locally.
